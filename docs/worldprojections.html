    <h1>In this project I learned how to display images in different projections</h1>
    
    <h2 style="color:red">Describe in your own words how you displayed the map in different projections using QGIS</h2>
    <p>I first downloaded and uploaded the natural earth map data from sakai and then messed around a bit with the indicatrix mapper. After I adjusted the position of the caps and graticules to what I though was reasonable I started changing the map projections. I looked under the properties in the project section and then adjusted and searched for ESPGs to help change the world projections. After I had finished applying the filters to get my desired world projections I used composer to export the maps as images.</p>
    
    <h2>WGS84 Projection</h2>
    <h3>A standard Mercator map, it preserves shape and angles well, but misrepresents area, especially near the poles.</h3>

    <h2>Aitoff Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection is rather distorted, almost in a fashion that resembles a globe. The scale of the different land masses seems to be more appropriate but there is warping in two directions instead of just one as seen in the Mercator projection.</h3>

    <h2>North pole Azimuthal Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection shows a top down point of view for the earth. While it may be an accurate display of the north pole's size and area as well as preserving distance, this projection becomes more distorted the further south you go, with antarctica being completely warped.</h3>

    <h2>Psuedo Mercator</h2>
    <h3>This projection is often used by online mapping services, such as google maps. It preserves shape and angles, even on a small scale. However,it misrepresents area vastly, with greenland appearing to be the size of africa. </h3>

    <h2>Sphere Winkel I projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection strikes a balance between accurate angles and accurate scale. While it isn't perfect in both it's sort of a blend between the azimuthal and mercator projections and is visually pleasing.</h3>

    <h2>Equidistant Conic Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection displays the world as sort of a flattened cone. It preserves distance, but all shape and angular accuracy is completely lost.</h3>
    <a href="..//maps/World Equidistant Conic.png">

    </a>
    <h2>World Cylindrical Equal Area </h2>
    <h3>This projection preserves area, but the scale and shape of land masses are a bit off. Noticably there's compression near the poles and the angles aren't accurate like a mercator.</h3>

    </a>
    <h2>World Eckert V</h2>
    <h3>This world projection is pseudocylindric, and has a straight equator line. The distortions make this world projection one that does not have accurate area, shape or distance.</h3>
    <a href="maps/World Eckert V.png">

    </a>
    <h2>World Polyconic</h2>
    <h3>This projection is made up of many cones, as the name implies. It has curved meridians rather than straight meridians like its conic counterparts.</h3>
